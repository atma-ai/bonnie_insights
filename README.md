# GrowthApp

This is my very first website built after learning the basics in HTML, CSS and JS,
It has different grid layouts and multiple sections for the webpage.
This is a simple website for a SaaS company.

# What I Learned

* Core Principals using modern CSS grid
* Implementing JavaScript to interact with the accordion menu
